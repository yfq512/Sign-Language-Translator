# Submission for UBC LHD Build Day
(Theme: "diversity, inclusivity, and accessibility")
## The Problem
In the USA, there are 250 000 to 500 000 individuals who know ASL. Out of the total population, that is .2%. Most of these indivudals are deaf or hard of hearing, and in order to interact with the world, must rely on observing mouth patterns, which can be difficult due to each indivudals unique speech pattern. 


### Our Solution 
Our solution is a web app that quickly translates speech to ASL. Users can either type or speak directly to the webapp, and in return, are given a translation of their speech in ASL. A Google cloud API that utilizes neural networks is able to translate speech with astounding accuracy. The app is easy to use, and more efficent than searching up commands. This creates a pathway for those hard of hearing and those who have never been introduced to ASL.
